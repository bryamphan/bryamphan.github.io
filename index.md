### CPSC 120

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-04-bryan-trace)

    Lab 4, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was the first lab where we implemented “if” and “if else” statements. Through this lab, I learned and practiced correctly writing “if” and “if else” statements through programming a game of Hi-Lo. I wrote functions that calculated whether or not Player 2 could guess Player 1’s secret number in two tries. I had a lot of trouble writing “if” and “if else” initially, but this lab helped me learn how to implement them into code properly. 

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-bryan-and-tom)

    Lab 8, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I learned how to validate a command-line argument input. In Lab 8, I wrote a program that took a command line input of numbers and found their average sum. Through this lab, I had to write a function that validates that there is at least one command line argument, and if not, it would produce an error message. It’s also a favorite lab because it was helpful as a guide for my future labs, which many also consisted of validating command-line arguments. 

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-thomas-and-bryan)

    Lab 11, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I learned how to write member function definitions for object-oriented classes and used the try-and-catch block for the first time. I previously wasn’t familiar with the try-and-catch block, so using it in this lab refreshed my memory. I also practiced writing code that would read arguments from another file, which I’ve struggled with since the beginning. In this lab, I wrote a program that found the pizza with the highest and lowest price-per-2000 calories that also dealt with object-oriented classes.
